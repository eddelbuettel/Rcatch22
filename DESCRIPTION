Description: Calculation of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics in R. Calculates 22 summary 
    statistics on input time-series vectors to enable pattern detection, similarity analysis, 
    classification, and regression applications in the feature space. All calculations are coded 
    in C for computational efficiency and scalability to large datasets.
